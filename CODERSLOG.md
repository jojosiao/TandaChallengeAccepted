* I realized that there are many ways to do something for Rails.
  Like in my case during this day I am doing this, setting up
  migration files can be done by generating a model. with the generated
  model, the migration file is also created in db/schema/migrate.

  just type, *rails g model <ModelName> *
  To generate the migration file only, 
  just type, * rails g migration <MigrationName> *

  TODO:
  1.) I started creating the views ending in .html.erb.
      I already have some background in creating/editing .erb files.

  2.) To start working on user registration, login, and logout.
